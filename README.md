# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

VBA in Excel can be used to automate Excel functions and formulas in an effort drastically minimuze labor intensive formatting and the inputting of data.  Steve is helping his parents analyze the stock market so that they can make investment decisions which will result in positive returns.  Initially, his parents were interested in one specific investment opportunity with DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ), a company that resonated with them due to many of their green energy initiatives.  After initial review of DQ's stock performance in 2018, the results showed a -62.6% return.  

This then prompted Steve and his parents to expand the analysis to include at least a dozen more companies, potentially more in the future, seeking a more profitiable investment opportunity.  The initial VBA code and Excel spreadsheet provided to Steve and his parents that provided a full analysis of 12 company stocks was functional but its efficiency was not optimized for this dataset and especially not for a larger dataset that might be used in the future.  Below are the results of the refactored VBA code provided to Steve and his parents, which as will be shown, out performed the initial VBA code. 

## Results

The analysis of stocks for Steve and his parents was conducted on a dataset with the results from fiscal 2017 and 2018.  Starting with the results from 2017, about 92% of the companies analyzed saw positive returns at the end of 2017.  Solely looking at this extracted data, though showing great performance, does not provide insight into company and/or market trend.

Initially, the VBA code used to analyze the broader stock performance in 2017 ran smoothly, but not very fast, and it did not format the compiled results in a visual manner.  Here is a screenshot of the first attempt to run the VBA code:
